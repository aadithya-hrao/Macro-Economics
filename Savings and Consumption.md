## Relationship Between Savings and Consumption
- **Savings** allows movement of income and consumption across time.
  - Saving: Setting aside income for future consumption.
  - Borrowing: Using future income for current consumption (negative savings).
- Examines effects of **income changes** and **interest rates** in a two-period consumer model.
- **Representative agent model**: Individual behavior averaged to represent macroeconomic trends.

## Definitions
- **Personal Savings**:  
  $$ \text{Savings} = \text{Current Income} - \text{Current Consumption} $$
  - **Flow variable** (measured over a period, e.g., per week).
- **Personal Wealth**:  
  $$ \text{Wealth} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities} $$
  - **Stock variable** (accumulates over time).
- **Analogy**:  
  - **Deficit** (flow) vs. **Debt** (stock) at the national level.

## Reasons for Saving or Borrowing
1. **Long-term goals** (e.g., vacation, house, education).
   - Borrowing for education increases **lifetime earnings** and **utility**.
2. **Precautionary Savings** (emergency funds).
   - Recommended: **Six months of income** in savings.
3. **Bequest Savings** (leaving wealth behind).
   - Example: A janitor secretly amassed $4M and donated it.

## The Savings Life Cycle
- **Consumption Smoothing**:  
  - Aim for **stable consumption** over a lifetime.
  - Income fluctuations managed by saving/borrowing.
- **Income Roller Coaster**:
  - **Young age**: Borrowing (e.g., student loans).
  - **Prime earning years**: High income, saving more.
  - **Retirement**: Using savings to maintain living standards.
# Two-Period Consumer Model

## Model Overview
- We simplify life into **two periods**.
- Each period has **budget constraints** with **resources (income)** and **uses (consumption and savings)**.
- **Period 1:**  
  - Income: $y_1$  
  - Consumption: $c_1$  
  - Savings: $b = y_1 - c_1$ (can be positive for savers, negative for borrowers).
- **Period 2:**  
  - Income: $y_2$  
  - Return on savings: $b(1+r)$, where $r$ is the **real interest rate**.
  - Consumption: $c_2$.

## Lifetime Budget Constraint
1. **Period 1 budget constraint:**  
   $$ b = y_1 - c_1 $$
2. **Period 2 budget constraint:**  
   $$ c_2 = y_2 + (1+r) b $$
3. **Substituting $b$:**  
   $$ c_2 = y_2 + (1+r)(y_1 - c_1) $$
4. **Rearrange for the lifetime budget constraint:**  
   $$ c_1 + \frac{c_2}{1+r} = y_1 + \frac{y_2}{1+r} $$
   - **Left-hand side:** Present value of **uses**.  
   - **Right-hand side:** Present value of **resources**.  
   - This helps determine how much to **save now** to fund future consumption.

## Graphical Representation
- **X-axis:** $c_1$ (current consumption).  
- **Y-axis:** $c_2$ (future consumption).  
- **Budget constraint:** Represents possible consumption choices.  
- **Consumption smoothing:** People prefer a **balanced** path of consumption over time.

## Income Effects
1. **Increase in current income ($y_1$):**  
   - **Parallel outward shift** in the budget constraint.  
   - Consumption increases in **both periods**.  
   - Savings increases (some income is saved for the future).  

1. **Increase in future income ($y_2$):**  
   - **Parallel outward shift** in the budget constraint.  
   - Consumption increases in **both periods**.  
   - Savings **decreases** (less need to save since future income is higher).  

## Consumption Smoothing
- People prefer **steady** consumption rather than extreme saving or spending.
- Most people are **neither extreme savers nor extreme spenders**.
- **Example Scenarios:**
  - **Receiving a bonus now**: Some of it is spent immediately, and some is saved.
  - **Expected future income increase**: Consumption increases **now**, savings decrease.

# Change in Real Interest Rate and Its Effects  

## Real Interest Rate Overview  
- The **real interest rate** is **adjusted for inflation** and represents the purchasing power of earned interest.  
- A change in the real interest rate affects **savings and consumption choices** through two effects:  
  - **Substitution Effect** (SE)  
  - **Wealth Effect** (WE)  

## Budget Constraint and Borrowing/Saving  
- In the **two-period model**, income ($Y_1, Y_2$) and consumption ($C_1, C_2$) are analyzed across two periods.  
- **No borrowing, no lending point**:  
  - At this point, **consumption equals income in both periods**.  
  - If $C_1 < Y_1$, **saver** (saving for the future).  
  - If $C_1 > Y_1$, **borrower** (borrowing against the future).  

## Effects of a Change in the Real Interest Rate  
- **Budget constraint pivots** around the no borrowing, no lending point.  
- **For borrowers**: Higher interest rates **increase borrowing costs**, leading to lower consumption in Period 1.  
- **For savers**: Higher interest rates **increase returns on savings**, making future consumption more attractive.  

## Substitution Effect (SE)  
- Affects **both savers and borrowers the same way**:  
  - **Higher interest rates increase the opportunity cost of consuming now.**  
  - Consumers shift **consumption from Period 1 to Period 2**.  
  - Mathematically:   $C_1 \downarrow, C_2 \uparrow$
  - **Savings increase** since less is consumed in Period 1:   $S \uparrow$

## Wealth Effect (WE)  
- **For borrowers**:  
  - **Higher interest rates increase borrowing costs** → Less wealth → Lower consumption in both periods:  $C_1 \downarrow, C_2 \downarrow$
  - **Higher savings required to cover higher debt payments**:  $S \uparrow$
- **For savers**:  
  - **Higher interest rates increase asset returns** → More wealth → Higher consumption in both periods:  $C_1 \uparrow, C_2 \uparrow$
  - **Less need to save since future wealth grows faster**:  $S \downarrow$

## Net Effects  
- **For borrowers**:  
  - **Consumption in Period 1 decreases** ($C_1 \downarrow$).  
  - **Consumption in Period 2 is ambiguous** (SE says $C_2 \uparrow$, WE says $C_2 \downarrow$).  
  - **Savings increase** ($S \uparrow$).  
- **For savers**:  
  - **Consumption in Period 1 is ambiguous** (SE says $C_1 \downarrow$, WE says $C_1 \uparrow$).  
  - **Consumption in Period 2 increases** ($C_2 \uparrow$).  
  - **Savings are ambiguous** (SE says $S \uparrow$, WE says $S \downarrow$).  

## Summary  
- **Higher real interest rates**:  
  - **Reduce consumption today** due to SE.  
  - **Increase savings for borrowers** but make savings ambiguous for savers.  
  - **Create different WE effects**:  
    - **Borrowers feel poorer** → Consume less in both periods.  
    - **Savers feel wealthier** → Consume more in both periods.  
- **Savings is the mechanism for shifting consumption between periods**.

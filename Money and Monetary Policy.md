## What is Money?  
- **Definition**: Any asset that can be used in a transaction.  
- **Liquidity**: Describes how easily money can be used in transactions.  
  - **Most liquid**: Cash.  
  - **Less liquid**: Assets like houses require more steps to use in transactions.  

## Types of Money  
- **Commodity Money**: Has intrinsic value (e.g., cigarettes in a POW camp).  
- **Fiat Money**: Has no intrinsic value, derives value from government backing.  

## The Role of Money  
1. **Medium of Exchange**: Replaces barter, making transactions efficient.  
2. **Unit of Account**: Standard measure for comparing values of goods and services.  
3. **Store of Value**: Maintains purchasing power over time (but loses value due to inflation if not earning interest).  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Monetary policy** is conducted by the Federal Reserve to control the money supply and influence interest rates, inflation, and employment.  
- **Without money**, barter systems create inefficiencies in trading.  
- **Money simplifies value comparisons** and prevents the complexities of direct utility calculations.  
- **Inflation erodes money’s value** over time if not placed in interest-earning assets.  
# The Federal Reserve and the Money Supply

## The Role of the Federal Reserve  
- **Central Bank of the United States**  
- **Main Responsibilities**:  
  - Conducts **monetary policy** to control the money supply.  
  - Affects **interest rates, inflation, and employment**.  
  - Regulates banks and enforces financial rules.  
  - Conducts **stress tests** to ensure financial stability.  
  - Serves as a **bank for commercial banks**.  

## The Fractional Reserve Banking System  
- **Definition**: Banks keep a fraction of deposits as reserves and loan out the rest.  
- **Effect**: Money supply grows beyond the physical currency in circulation.  

## DeNiccoville Example: How Money Grows  
1. **Introduction of Currency**:  
   - 1.5 million DeNickels introduced.  
   - 500,000 DeNickels held as public currency.  
   - 1 million DeNickels deposited into banks.  

2. **Banking System Operations**:  
   - Banks **keep 10%** in reserves (5% required + 5% excess).  
   - **Loan out the remaining 90%** to borrowers.  
   - Borrowers **redeposit loans**, increasing deposits.  
   - This process **repeats**, growing total deposits.  

3. **Final Money Supply Calculation**:  
   - **Money Multiplier** = **1 / Reserve Ratio** = **1 / 0.10 = 10**  
   - **Deposits** = **1 million × 10 = 10 million** DeNickels.  
   - **Money Supply** = **Deposits (10M) + Public Currency (500K) = 10.5M** DeNickels.  

## Key Takeaways  
- **Money supply expands** beyond physical currency through loans and deposits.  
- **Money multiplier** determines the extent of money growth.  
- **Bank stability depends on** borrowers repaying loans and asset values remaining stable.  
- **If assets decline**, banks may face **balance sheet issues** (liabilities > assets).  
# Money Market and Monetary Policy  

## Money Market Overview  
- **Axes:**  
  - **Horizontal:** Quantity of money  
  - **Vertical:** Price of money (Nominal Interest Rate)  
- **Why Nominal Interest Rate?**  
  - Money is nominal, so we use the **nominal** interest rate instead of the **real** interest rate.  

## Money Demand and Supply  
- **Money Demand:**  
  - Downward-sloping because **nominal interest rate = opportunity cost of holding money**.  
  - Lower interest rates → lower opportunity cost → people hold & spend more money.  
- **Money Supply:**  
  - **Vertical line** (fixed by the Federal Reserve).  
  - The Fed **controls** the money supply to influence interest rates, inflation, and employment.  

## Monetary Policy: Open Market Operations  
- **Primary tool of the Federal Reserve** → Buying & selling **government Treasury bonds**.  
- **Key rule:**  
  - The Fed **cannot buy bonds directly** from the government.  
  - Treasury **first auctions** bonds to the public, then the Fed trades with the public.  

### **Expansionary Monetary Policy** (Open Market Purchase)  
- **Fed buys bonds from the public** → Injects money into the economy → **Increases money supply**.  
- **Effects:**  
  - **Lower nominal interest rates** → Encourages consumption & investment.  
  - **Real interest rates decrease** → Boosts **net exports** and **GDP growth**.  
  - **Potential downside:** Increased **inflation** as aggregate demand rises.  

### **Contractionary Monetary Policy** (Open Market Sale)  
- **Fed sells bonds to the public** → Pulls money out of circulation → **Decreases money supply**.  
- **Effects:**  
  - **Higher nominal interest rates** → Slows down consumption & investment.  
  - Used to **combat inflation** by cooling down economic activity.  

## Other Monetary Policy Tools  
### **1. Reserve Requirement**  
- **Lowering reserve ratio (Expansionary)** → Increases money supply via **higher money multiplier**.  
- **Raising reserve ratio (Contractionary)** → Reduces money supply.  

### **2. Discount Rate (Discount Window Lending)**  
- Banks borrow from the Fed at the **discount rate** (less common than interbank borrowing).  
- **Lower discount rate (Expansionary)** → Encourages banks to lend more.  
- **Higher discount rate (Contractionary)** → Restricts lending.  

### **3. Federal Funds Rate**  
- **Interest rate at which banks lend to each other** (Fed’s key target rate).  
- **Lower federal funds rate (Expansionary)** → Cheaper borrowing → More loans → Economic growth.  
- **Higher federal funds rate (Contractionary)** → More expensive borrowing → Slows the economy.  
# The Federal Reserve and Full Employment  

## Full Employment and Natural Rate of Unemployment  
- **Full employment** means achieving the **natural rate of unemployment**, which includes:  
  - **Structural unemployment** (skills mismatch).  
  - **Frictional unemployment** (job search process).  
- The Fed aims to **reduce cyclical unemployment** to reach full employment.  

## The Phillips Curve and Sticky Wage Theory  
- The **Phillips Curve** shows an **inverse relationship** between inflation and unemployment.  
- **Equation:**  
  - Unemployment = natural rate of unemployment - (sensitivity parameter) × (inflation - expected inflation).  
- **Sticky wage theory:**  
  - Nominal wages **do not adjust quickly** to price level changes.  
  - If inflation **rises above expectations**, real wages **fall**, reducing labor costs and increasing hiring.  
  - Expansionary monetary policy → **higher prices** → **lower real wages** → **higher employment**.  

## The Role of Expectations in Inflation  
- **If inflation is sustained, expectations adjust**:  
  - Workers demand higher wages → firms raise prices → **wage-price spiral**.  
  - Leads to **stagflation** (high inflation + high unemployment).  
- **Expectations-Augmented Phillips Curve**:  
  - If expected inflation **rises**, the Phillips Curve **shifts**.  
  - Can result in **both high inflation and high unemployment**.  

## Money Demand and Its Determinants  
- **Money demand increases when**:  
  1. **Income rises** → People **buy more**, needing more money.  
  2. **Price levels rise** → Necessities become more expensive, requiring more money.  
- **Higher money demand leads to higher nominal interest rates.**  

## Importance for Fiscal and Monetary Policy  
- Changes in money demand and inflation expectations influence **aggregate supply and fiscal policy effectiveness**.  
# Exchange Rates: Nominal and Real

## Nominal Exchange Rate  
- **Definition**: The rate at which one currency exchanges for another.  
- **Appreciation**: Currency can buy more of another currency.  
- **Depreciation**: Currency buys less of another currency.  
- **Example**: If USD appreciates against EUR, $1 buys more euros.

## Real Exchange Rate  
- **Definition**: The rate at which goods and services of one country exchange for another’s.  
- **Formula**: Nominal exchange rate × (Domestic price level / Foreign price level).  
- **Concept**: Measures purchasing power across countries.  
- **Example**: If American cheese and Canadian cheese both cost $1 per pound, the real exchange rate is 1.  
  - If Canadian cheese price drops to $0.50 per pound, the real exchange rate increases to 2.  

## Real Exchange Rate and Net Exports  
- **Depreciation (lower real exchange rate)** → Domestic goods cheaper → Exports increase, imports decrease → **Net exports rise**.  
- **Appreciation (higher real exchange rate)** → Domestic goods expensive → Imports increase, exports decrease → **Net exports fall**.  

## Market for Dollars and Exchange Rate Determination  
- **Supply of Dollars**: Represents net capital outflows (purchasing foreign assets).  
  - **Depends on real interest rate**, not the exchange rate.  
- **Demand for Dollars**: Represents demand for American goods and services.  
  - **Depends on exchange rate**: As real exchange rate decreases, demand for U.S. goods rises.  
- **Equilibrium**: The intersection of supply and demand determines the real exchange rate.

## Effect of Monetary Policy on Exchange Rates  
### Open Market Sale (Contractionary Policy)  
1. **Fed sells bonds** → Decreases money supply → Nominal interest rates rise.  
2. **Higher real interest rate** → More attractive U.S. assets → **Dollars flow back to the U.S.**  
3. **Decreased supply of dollars in foreign exchange markets** → **Real exchange rate appreciates**.  
4. **Stronger dollar** → **U.S. goods more expensive** → Net exports decrease.  

Overall, **real exchange rates drive net exports**, affecting trade balances and overall economic dynamics.

# Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) Theory

- **Definition**: PPP theory suggests that nominal exchange rates adjust over time to account for differences in price levels across countries.
- **Analogy**: Known as the "Big Mac Theory," it assumes a product (e.g., a burger) should cost the same in different countries after adjusting for exchange rates.
- **Key Concept**: The **real exchange rate** should ideally be **equal to 1** to prevent arbitrage opportunities.

## Why PPP Doesn't Hold Perfectly
1. **Goods are not easily or costlessly traded**  
   - Importing a cheaper product may erase price differences due to transport costs.
   - Prices tend to remain local rather than fully equalizing internationally.

2. **Goods are not perfect substitutes**  
   - Quality differences (e.g., better ingredients in one country) justify price gaps.
   - Consumers may be willing to pay more for higher quality, but price gaps cannot be too large.

## Implications of PPP
- While PPP does not hold perfectly, it explains why **nominal exchange rates adjust** over time.
- Large price differences create arbitrage opportunities, leading to trade adjustments.
- Exchange rates move to prevent extreme disparities in purchasing power.

# Recap of Money and Monetary Policy
- **Definition of Money**: Any asset used in exchange.
- **Three Functions of Money**:  
  1. Medium of exchange  
  2. Unit of account  
  3. Store of value  

## Money Market and Monetary Policy
- **Money Market**:  
  - **Price** = Nominal interest rate  
  - **Quantity** = Quantity of money  
  - **Demand for money** is downward sloping (lower interest rates → more demand for money).  
  - **Money supply is vertical** (controlled by the Federal Reserve).  

- **Types of Monetary Policy**:  
  1. **Expansionary** → Increases money supply, lowers interest rates.  
  2. **Contractionary** → Decreases money supply, raises interest rates.  

- **Tools of Monetary Policy**:  
  1. **Open market operations** (buying/selling bonds).  
  2. **Changing the reserve ratio**.  
  3. **Changing the discount rate**.  

- **Effects on Employment**:  
  - Fed uses policies to influence inflation and employment (Phillips curve relationship).

## Exchange Rates and International Trade
- **Nominal exchange rate**: How much foreign currency can be obtained with a unit of domestic currency.  
- **Real exchange rate**: How much foreign goods/services can be obtained with domestic goods/services.  
- **Key driver of net exports**: Affects trade balances.  
- **Supply & demand determine exchange rates**:  
  - **Demand for dollars** = Driven by net exports.  
  - **Supply of dollars** = Driven by net capital outflows.  

## Interaction Between Monetary Policy and Exchange Rates
- **Monetary policy affects interest rates → influences real exchange rates → impacts net exports and capital flows**.
- **Lower interest rates** → Weaker currency → Higher net exports.  
- **Higher interest rates** → Stronger currency → Lower net exports.

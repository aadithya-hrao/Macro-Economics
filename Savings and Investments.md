## Financial Institutions and Markets  
- **Financial institutions** connect savers and borrowers.  
- **Key financial markets**: Stocks and bonds (Wall Street).  

## Investment vs. Savings in Economics  
- **Finance definition**: Buying stocks/bonds = "investment."  
- **Economics definition**: Investment = purchase of **physical capital** (factories, equipment, machinery, new homes, inventory changes).  
- Savings refers to the purchase of **financial assets** like stocks and bonds.  

## Direct Borrowing Through Financial Markets  
1. **Stocks**  
   - Buying stock = partial ownership in a company.  
   - Firms sell stocks to raise money for physical capital.  
   - If the company grows, stock value increases → profit for shareholders.  

2. **Bonds**  
   - Bonds = IOUs; lenders buy bonds expecting repayment with interest.  
   - Example: Buy a bond for **$950**, get **$1,000** back in a year.  
   - The difference is the **yield** (interest earned).  

## Bond Prices and Interest Rates Relationship  
- Bonds have a **face value** (amount paid back at maturity).  
- Price of a bond depends on **prevailing interest rates** in the market.  
- Formula: **Net Present Value** of a bond:  
  $\text{Price} = \dfrac{\text{Face Value}}{1 + \text{Interest Rate}}$  
  Example: If a bond’s face value is **$1,000** and market interest rate is **8%**:  
  $\text{Price} = \dfrac{1000}{1.08} = 926$  
- **Inverse relationship**:  
  - **If interest rates decrease → bond prices increase.**  
  - **If interest rates increase → bond prices decrease.**  

## Indirect Borrowing Through Financial Intermediaries  
1. **Banks**  
   - Savers deposit money → Banks lend to borrowers at a higher interest rate.  
   - Profit comes from the difference between deposit and loan rates.  

2. **Mutual Funds**  
   - Pool money from investors.  
   - Fund managers buy a mix of stocks/bonds for diversification.  
   - Common for retirement savings.  

# Market for Loanable Funds in a Closed Economy

## Introduction  
- The **market for loanable funds** is where **savings and investment** take place.  
- **Closed economy**: No net exports ($NX = 0$).  
- In a closed economy, **savings must always equal investment** ($S = I$).  

## Market Structure  
- **Horizontal axis**: Quantity of loanable funds.  
- **Vertical axis**: Real interest rate ($r$).  
- **Demand for loanable funds**: Comes from private investment (e.g., factories, machinery).  
- **Supply of loanable funds**: Comes from national savings.  

## Demand for Loanable Funds  
- **Downward sloping**: As $r$ decreases, borrowing becomes cheaper, leading to more investment.  
- Real interest rate is the **opportunity cost of investment**.  
- Lower $r$ → Lower cost of borrowing → Higher investment demand.  

## Supply of Loanable Funds  
- **Upward sloping**: As $r$ increases, saving becomes more attractive.  
- Comes from **national savings** ($S = Y - C - G$).  
  - **Private savings**: $Y - C - T$.  
  - **Public savings**: $T - G$.  
- **Fiscal surplus**: $T > G$ (more savings).  
- **Fiscal deficit**: $T < G$ (less savings).  

## Equilibrium  
- Market clears where **supply of loanable funds = demand for loanable funds**.  
- **Equilibrium real interest rate ($r^*$)**: Balances savings and investment.  

## Shifts in Supply of Loanable Funds  
1. **Increase in current income ($Y$) → Rightward shift**  
   - Higher income → More savings → More loanable funds.  
   - Higher supply → Lower equilibrium $r^*$ → More investment.  

2. **Decrease in current income ($Y$) → Leftward shift**  
   - Lower income → Less savings → Fewer loanable funds.  
   - Lower supply → Higher equilibrium $r^*$ → Less investment.  

3. **Increase in government purchases ($G$) → Leftward shift**  
   - Higher $G$ → Lower national savings ($S$).  
   - **Crowding out effect**: Higher $G$ reduces private investment.  

## Crowding Out Effect  
- **Higher government spending ($G$) decreases national savings ($S$), shifting supply left**.  
- Leads to **higher real interest rates ($r$) and lower private investment ($I$)**.  
- Debate between economic schools:  
  - **Neoclassical (supply-side)**: Crowding out reduces long-run growth.  
  - **New Keynesians (demand-side)**: Government spending stabilizes the economy in downturns.  
- **Monetary policy** can mitigate crowding out by lowering interest rates.  

# Capital Investment & Loanable Funds

## Key Concepts  
- **Investment & Loanable Funds**: Demand for loanable funds represents investment in physical capital.
- **Marginal Analysis**: Firms decide how much capital to purchase based on marginal product and marginal cost.

## Marginal Product of Capital (MPK)  
- MPK = Additional production from one more unit of capital.
- Diminishing MPK: Each additional unit of capital yields less output.

## Marginal Revenue Product of Capital (MRPK)  
- MRPK = MPK × Price of output.
- Represents additional revenue from purchasing one more unit of capital.

## Marginal Cost of Capital (MCC)  
- **User Cost of Capital (UCC)** = Opportunity cost + Depreciation:
  - Opportunity Cost = Price of Capital × Real Interest Rate.
  - Depreciation = Price of Capital × Depreciation Rate.
- Firms compare MRPK to MCC to decide how much capital to purchase.

## Optimal Capital Investment Decision  
- If **MRPK > MCC**, buy more capital.
- If **MRPK < MCC**, do not invest.
- Stop at the point where **MRPK = MCC**.

## Graphical Representation  
- **MPK Curve**: Downward sloping (diminishing returns).
- **MCC Curve**: Assumed constant.
- **Equilibrium**: Optimal capital is where **MPK = MCC**.

## Macroeconomic Implications  
1. **Increase in MPK** (e.g., technological improvement) → Firms demand more capital → **Higher demand for loanable funds** → **Higher real interest rates**.
2. **Increase in MCC** (e.g., costlier capital due to regulation) → Firms demand less capital → **Lower demand for loanable funds** → **Lower real interest rates**.

# Open Economy and Net Capital Outflows

We've talked about our closed economy.  
Now we're going to open it up.  
We're going to allow for net exports.  

## Closed vs. Open Economy  
- A **closed economy** means no net exports.  
- An **open economy** means we have net exports and allow for international trade.  

Whenever we talk about international trade, we also discuss **international finance**.  

## Net Capital Outflows (NCO)  
A new term: **Net Capital Outflows (NCO)**  
It might sound confusing at first, but here’s the definition:  

> **NCO = Net change in domestic ownership of foreign assets – Net change in foreign ownership of domestic assets**  

### Shortcut to Understanding NCO:
- If **domestic ownership of foreign assets** increases → **NCO goes up**  
- If **foreign ownership of domestic assets** increases → **NCO goes down**  

NCO is the **other side of the trade coin**:  
- **Net Exports (NX)** = goods & services  
- **Net Capital Outflows (NCO)** = assets  

### Example:  
Imagine I have a **zombie figurine** worth **$1 million** and sell it to another country.  
- This is a **good**, part of **net exports**.  
- In exchange, I get **$1 million in assets** → this is **net capital outflows**.  

By identity:  
**Net Exports (NX) = Net Capital Outflows (NCO)**  

## National Savings in an Open Economy  
We still define **National Savings (S)** as:  

**S = GDP – Consumption – Government Purchases**  

But now:  
**S = Investment (I) + Net Exports (NX)**  

### Rearranging:  
**S – I = NX**  
**S – I = NCO**  

Since **NX = NCO**, we can conclude:  

- If **I > S**, then **NX & NCO < 0** (Trade Deficit)  
- If **S > I**, then **NX & NCO > 0** (Trade Surplus)  

## Understanding the Relationship  

### If **Investment > Savings**  
- Domestic **demand** for goods **exceeds** domestic **production**  
- How do we meet this demand? **Imports increase** → **NX < 0**  
- How do we fund it? We **borrow from the rest of the world** → **NCO < 0**  

### If **Savings > Investment**  
- Domestic **production** exceeds **domestic demand**  
- The extra production is **exported** → **NX > 0**  
- The extra income is **lent to the rest of the world** → **NCO > 0**  

## The Asset Side of the Trade Coin  

### If **I > S**  
- Demand for **loanable funds** > Supply of **loanable funds**  
- To cover the gap, we **borrow from the rest of the world**  
- We **sell domestic assets (stocks & bonds) to foreign investors**  
- This **increases foreign ownership of domestic assets**, **NCO < 0**  

### If **S > I**  
- Supply of **loanable funds** > Demand for **loanable funds**  
- Extra savings are **lent abroad** → **NCO > 0**  
- We **buy foreign assets (stocks & bonds)**  
- This **increases domestic ownership of foreign assets**, **NCO > 0**  

## Graphical Representation  
### Loanable Funds Market  
- **Vertical axis:** Real Interest Rate  
- **Horizontal axis:** Quantity of Loanable Funds  
- **Demand for Loanable Funds**:  
  - Includes **investment demand**  
  - Includes **demand for foreign assets** (NCO)  

**Equilibrium:**  
- Where **Supply of Loanable Funds = Demand for Loanable Funds**  

### Interest Rates and Global Markets  

#### **Case 1: Facing a Higher World Interest Rate**  
- **Higher interest rate → More attractive savings** → **Supply of Loanable Funds ↑**  
- **Higher interest rate → More expensive borrowing** → **Demand for Loanable Funds ↓**  
- **Savings > Investment** → **NCO > 0, NX > 0** (Net lending to the world)  

#### **Case 2: Facing a Lower World Interest Rate**  
- **Lower interest rate → Less attractive savings** → **Supply of Loanable Funds ↓**  
- **Lower interest rate → Cheaper borrowing** → **Demand for Loanable Funds ↑**  
- **Investment > Savings** → **NCO < 0, NX < 0** (Net borrowing from the world)  

## Conclusion  
- **NX = NCO** → Two sides of the trade coin  
- **If S > I** → Trade surplus, net lending to the world  
- **If I > S** → Trade deficit, net borrowing from the world  

# Interaction Between Countries in the World Market for Loanable Funds

## Assumptions:
- **Two-country model:** United States and China.
- **Large open economies:** Changes in their interest rates affect the world interest rate.
- **Initial closed economies:** Each country faces its own **autarky interest rate**.
- **Opening up:** Both countries transition to a common **world interest rate** (a weighted average of their autarky interest rates).

## Effects of Opening Economies:
- **United States:**
  - Faces a **lower** interest rate.
  - **Investment increases** (lower opportunity cost of investment).
  - **Savings decrease** (less attractive to save).
  - **Investment > Savings → US must borrow from the rest of the world**.
  - **Net exports and net capital outflows < 0**.

- **China:**
  - Faces a **higher** interest rate.
  - **Savings increase** (higher return on savings).
  - **Investment decreases** (higher opportunity cost).
  - **Savings > Investment → China lends to the rest of the world**.
  - **Net exports and net capital outflows > 0**.

- **Key Principle:**  
  - **Net capital outflows must sum to zero globally**:
    - If the US borrows $100, China must lend $100.
    - If China exports $100, the US must import $100.

## Policy Change: US Encourages More Savings
- **Increased savings → Supply of loanable funds shifts right** in the US.
- **US autarky interest rate falls → Lowers world interest rate**.
- **Global Effects:**
  - **US:**  
    - **Savings increase**.  
    - **Investment increases** (moving along demand curve due to lower interest rate).  
  - **China:**  
    - **Investment increases** (lower interest rate → more attractive).  
    - **Savings decrease** (lower return on savings).  

- **Final Equilibrium:**  
  - **Smaller trade imbalances:**  
    - If previously, the US borrowed $100 and China lent $100, now it may be $50.  
  - **Net exports and net capital outflows still sum to zero globally**.

## Recap
- **Market for loanable funds:**  
  - Savings = Supply, Investment = Demand.  
  - **Closed economy:** Savings = Investment.  
  - **Open economy:** Includes **net capital outflows** (savings-investment gap).  
- **Opening economies → Common world interest rate**.  
- **Policy changes affect global interest rates & investment flows**.

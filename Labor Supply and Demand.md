# Introduction

## Microeconomic Foundation of Labor Demand
- Firms decide how many workers to hire to **maximize profits**.
- Assumption: Behavior of one firm represents the **aggregate behavior** of firms.

## Assumptions in the Labor Market
1. **Fixed Capital**: Tools, machinery, and equipment are **constant**.
   - Leads to **diminishing marginal productivity** as more workers share the same capital.
2. **Homogeneous Workers**:  
   - All workers have **equal productivity**.
   - No differences in skill, wage, or efficiency.
3. **Profit Maximization**:  
   - Firms hire workers **only for profit**, not for social reasons.
   - Decisions are based on **marginal analysis**.
4. **Competitive Markets**:  
   - No single firm influences wages or prices.

## Marginal Analysis in Hiring Decisions
- **Marginal Product of Labor ($MP_L$)**: Additional output from one more worker.
  - **Diminishing Marginal Productivity**: $MP_L$ decreases as more workers are added.
- **Marginal Revenue Product of Labor ($MRP_L$)**: $MP_L$ × Price of output.
- **Marginal Cost of Labor ($MC_L$)**: Additional cost of hiring another worker.
  - If wage = $100, $MC_L$ is constant at $100.

### Hiring Rule
- Hire workers **until**:  
  $$ MRP_L = MC_L $$
- If $MRP_L > MC_L$, hire more workers.  
- If $MRP_L < MC_L$, stop hiring.

## Discrete vs. Continuous Analysis
- **Discrete**: Hiring decisions made in whole numbers.
- **Continuous**: Modeled as a **downward-sloping labor demand curve**.

## Aggregate Labor Demand
- The firm's **$MP_L$ curve is its labor demand curve**.
- **Market labor demand** is the sum of individual firms' $MP_L$ curves



# Labor Market Equilibrium and Shifts

## Aggregating Micro to Macro Labor Demand  
- Labor demand is derived from the **marginal product of labor (MPL)**.  
- Firms hire workers based on **profit maximization**, leading to a **downward-sloping labor demand curve**.  
- **As real wages decrease → marginal cost of labor decreases → firms hire more workers.**  

## Labor Supply Curve and Household Choices  
- **Upward-sloping labor supply curve** due to:  
  - **Substitution effect** (dominant): Higher wages → higher opportunity cost of leisure → more labor supplied.  
  - **Income effect**: Less relevant in this context.  
- **Equilibrium**: Intersection of supply and demand gives the **market-clearing real wage and employment level**.  

## Unemployment in a Perfectly Competitive Market  
- **If supply = demand, unemployment rate = 0.**  
- Workers **to the right of equilibrium are not unemployed**; they are not seeking work because their **reservation wage** is not met.  
- **Reservation wage**: Minimum wage required for an individual to accept a job.  

## Shifts in Labor Demand and Supply  

### Increase in Marginal Product of Labor (MPL)  
- **Factors increasing MPL**:  
  - **More physical capital** (e.g., better tools, machinery).  
  - **Technological advancements**.  
  - **Higher human capital** (education, skills).  
- **Effect**:  
  - **Rightward shift in labor demand** → **higher real wages & employment**.  
  - **Higher wages = economic success for policymakers**.  

### Decrease in Labor Supply  
- **Causes**:  
  - Retirement of **baby boomers**.  
  - **Brain drain** (emigration of skilled workers).  
- **Effect**:  
  - **Leftward shift in labor supply** → **higher real wages, lower employment**.  

### Negative Wealth Effect (Financial Crisis Example)  
- **2007 crisis** → retirement savings decline -> older workers **return to labor force**
- **"Age Twist" effect**:  
  - Older workers **compete with younger workers** for jobs.  
  - **Managers prefer experienced older workers** → hurts youth employment.  
- **Effect on labor market**:  
  - **Rightward shift in labor supply** → **lower real wages, higher employment**.  

## Summary of Effects  
| Factor                       | Shift          | Effect on Real Wage | Effect on Employment |     |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | --- |
| Higher MPL                   | Demand → Right | Increase            | Increase             |     |
| Lower Labor Supply           | Supply → Left  | Increase            | Decrease             |     |
| More Workers (Wealth Effect) | Supply → Right | Decrease            | Increase             |     |


# Search and Matching Model of Labor  

## Why Unemployment Exists  
- Real-world economies always have **some level of unemployment**.  
- **Models explaining unemployment:**  
  - **Efficiency Wage Model**: Firms pay above market-clearing wages to incentivize effort and reduce shirking.  
  - **Insider-Outsider Model**: Unions negotiate higher wages for existing workers, excluding outsiders.  
  - **Minimum Wage**: Can contribute to unemployment but is a **small part of the story**.  

## Search and Matching Model Overview  
- **Key Assumption Change**: Workers are **heterogeneous**, not homogeneous.  
- **Unemployment arises due to**:  
  - **Job search difficulties**.  
  - **Skills mismatches**.  
- **Natural Rate of Unemployment**:  
  - Two components: **frictional unemployment** and **structural unemployment**.  

## Model Assumptions  
- **Fixed labor force**: Number of workers is constant.  
- **Labor force normalization**: Set labor force = **1** to avoid scaling problems.  
  - **Employment = $1 - U$ (Unemployment)**  

## Long-Run Equilibrium Condition  
- **For unemployment rate to remain stable**:  
  - **Job losses = Job gains**  
  - Mathematically:  
    $$ s(1 - U) = U \cdot P \cdot H(W^*) $$  
  - **Variables:**  
    - $s$: Separation rate (job loss rate).  
    - **$U$**: Unemployed population.  
    - **$P$**: Frequency of job offers.  
    - **$H(W^*)$**: Fraction of job offers **above reservation wage**.  

## Equilibrium Unemployment Rate  
- Solving for $U$:  
  $$ U^* = \frac{S}{S + P H(W^*)} $$  
- **Higher separation rate ($S$) → Higher unemployment**.  
- **Higher job offers & acceptance rate ($P H(W^*)$) → Lower unemployment**.  

## Graphical Interpretation  
- **Flow from Employment to Unemployment**:  
  - **Downward sloping**.  
  - Intersects vertical axis at **separation rate ($S$)**.  
- **Flow from Unemployment to Employment**:  
  - **Upward sloping**.  
  - Intersects **origin** (when $U=0$).  
- **Equilibrium Unemployment Rate**: Where **both flows intersect**.  

## Reservation Wage ($W^*$)  
- **Decision Rule**: Accept a job **only if** the value of employment **≥** value of unemployment.  
- **Graph**:  
  - **Value of Employment ($V_e(W)$)**: Increases with wage but at a **decreasing rate** (due to diminishing marginal utility).  
  - **Value of Unemployment ($V_u$)**: Assumed **constant** (simplifying assumption).  
  - **$W^*$ = Wage at which $V_e(W) = V_u$**.  

## Factors Affecting Reservation Wage  
### **Factors Lowering $V_e(W)$ (Increasing $W^*$)**  
1. **Higher Wage Taxes** → Less take-home pay → **Higher reservation wage**.  
2. **Higher Separation Rate** → Less job stability → **Higher reservation wage**.  

### **Factors Increasing $V_u$ (Increasing $W^*$)**  
1. **Higher Unemployment Benefits** → Makes unemployment more attractive → **Higher reservation wage**.  
2. **Higher Job Offer Frequency** → More job opportunities → Workers demand higher wages → **Higher reservation wage**.  
# Labor Market Dynamics and Equilibrium Unemployment

## Increase in Unemployment Benefits
- **Effect on Reservation Wage**  
  - Higher unemployment benefits → Higher value of being unemployed  
  - Increases reservation wage (people require higher wages to accept jobs)  

- **Effect on Equilibrium Unemployment Rate**  
  - Higher reservation wage → Fewer accepted job offers  
  - Lower job acceptance rate → Higher unemployment rate  

- **Empirical Evidence**  
  - When unemployment benefits end → Job acceptance rates increase  

## Decrease in Wage Taxes
- **Effect on Reservation Wage**  
  - Lower wage taxes → Higher value of employment (workers keep more income)  
  - Lowers reservation wage (workers accept lower wages)  

- **Effect on Equilibrium Unemployment Rate**  
  - Lower reservation wage → Higher job acceptance rate  
  - More accepted job offers → Lower unemployment rate  

- **Opposite Effect**  
  - If wage taxes increase → Unemployment rate rises  

## Increase in Job Offer Rate (Frequency of Job Offers)
- **Direct Effect (Tends to Reduce Unemployment)**  
  - More job offers → More unemployed people receive job offers  
  - Leads to lower unemployment rate  

- **Indirect Effect (Tends to Increase Unemployment)**  
  - More job offers → Higher value of being unemployed (greater bargaining power)  
  - Raises reservation wage → Workers become pickier → Fewer job offers accepted  
  - Leads to higher unemployment rate  

- **Empirical Likelihood**  
  - More job offers usually reduce unemployment, but the effect is slower due to increased pickiness  

## Increase in Separation Rate (Job Losses)
- **Direct Effect (Increases Unemployment)**  
  - Higher separation rate → More people lose jobs → Higher unemployment  

- **Indirect Effect (Exacerbates Unemployment Increase)**  
  - Higher separation rate → Lower job stability → Lower lifetime earnings  
  - Lowers value of employment → Raises reservation wage  
  - Higher reservation wage → Fewer job offers accepted → Further increases unemployment  

## Summary of Labor Market Model
- **Initial Microeconomic Perspective**  
  - Firms hire workers based on marginal productivity vs. cost of labor  
  - Aggregated to macro-level labor demand and supply curves  

- **Introduction of Unemployment**  
  - Search and matching model explains frictions in job-finding  
  - **Equilibrium Unemployment Rate**: Balance between job flows in and out of employment  

- **Key Factors Affecting Equilibrium Unemployment**  
  - **Unemployment Benefits** ↑ → Unemployment Rate ↑  
  - **Wage Taxes** ↓ → Unemployment Rate ↓  
  - **Job Offer Frequency** ↑ → Mixed Effects (Overall ↓)  
  - **Separation Rate** ↑ → Unemployment Rate ↑

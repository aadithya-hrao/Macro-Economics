# Aggregate Supply and Demand  

## Overview  
- Aggregate Supply and Demand (AS-AD) combines concepts from the entire course into a single graph.  
- The AS-AD graph represents all markets in the economy.  
- **Vertical Axis:** Price Level (e.g., GDP Deflator).  
- **Horizontal Axis:** Output (GDP).  

## The Three Curves  
1. **Aggregate Demand (AD)** – Downward sloping.  
   - Equation: **C + I + G + NX** (Consumption, Investment, Government Purchases, Net Exports).  
2. **Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)** – Upward sloping.  
   - Dependent on price expectations and real output deviations.  
   - Sensitivity parameter **a** determines short-run deviations.  
3. **Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)** – Vertical.  
   - Represents steady-state output (**Y\***) from the Solow Growth Model.  
   - Determined by:  
     - **Total Factor Productivity (A)** (Technology).  
     - **Capital (K), Labor (L), Human Capital, and Natural Resources**.  
   - At **Y\***, the economy is at full employment (natural rate of unemployment).  

## Why Aggregate Demand is Downward Sloping  
1. **Wealth Effect**  
   - As prices decrease, real wealth increases → more consumption → **AD increases**.  
   - Example: Lower prices make consumers feel wealthier, leading to higher spending.  

2. **Interest Rate Effect**  
   - Lower prices → Lower money demand → More savings → Higher supply of loanable funds → Lower real interest rates → Cheaper borrowing → **Higher investment → AD increases**.  

3. **Exchange Rate Effect**  
   - Lower prices → Lower real interest rates → Capital outflows to foreign assets → Dollar depreciation → US exports increase, imports decrease → **Net exports increase → AD increases**.  

## Shifts in Aggregate Demand  
- **Any change in C, I, G, or NX (except price level) shifts AD.**  
- **Consumption:** Income, wealth, interest rates, taxes.  
- **Investment:** Marginal product of capital, user cost of capital.  
- **Government Purchases:** Fiscal policy changes (Lecture 19).  
- **Net Exports:** Foreign recessions, trade policies, exchange rates.  

# Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS) and Sticky Theories

## Why SRAS is Upward Sloping

1. **Sticky Price Theory**  
   - Prices of goods/services do not adjust instantly due to **menu costs** (costs of changing prices).  
   - Firms set prices based on expected price levels, but if aggregate demand increases, some firms delay price changes.  
   - Example: A restaurant may wait to reprint menus until multiple price changes justify the cost.  

2. **Sticky Wage Theory**  
   - **Nominal wages** are based on price expectations and adjust slowly.  
   - If price levels rise but wages remain fixed, **real wages** (wage adjusted for inflation) decrease.  
   - Lower real wages mean firms can hire more workers and increase output, leading to **higher SRAS**.  
   - In the long run, wages adjust upward, restoring equilibrium.  

## Shifts in Aggregate Supply

- **Long-Run Aggregate Supply (LRAS)** shifts due to:  
  - Increased **total factor productivity**  
  - More **capital, labor, human capital, or natural resources**  
  - Short-run aggregate supply always shifts with LRAS.  

- **Short-Run Aggregate Supply (SRAS)** shifts due to:  
  - Changes in **price expectations**  
  - No direct shift in LRAS from price expectations, but expectations adjust over time.  

## Economic Recovery via Sticky Wage Theory

1. **Recession (Negative Demand Shock)**  
   - A drop in wealth lowers consumption, shifting **aggregate demand (AD) left**.  
   - Lower price levels raise **real wages**, making labor **more expensive**.  
   - Firms cut workers and reduce output, moving **left along the SRAS curve**.  

2. **Recovery (Long-Run Adjustment)**  
   - Over time, **wage expectations adjust downward** as firms hire workers at lower real wages.  
   - Lower labor costs lead firms to **increase hiring and production**, shifting **SRAS right**.  
   - Economy returns to long-run equilibrium.  

## Summary

- **AD is downward sloping** due to:  
  - **Wealth effect, interest rate effect, and exchange rate effect.**  
- **SRAS is upward sloping** due to:  
  - **Sticky Price Theory (menu costs) and Sticky Wage Theory (slow wage adjustments).**  
- **Supply shifts:**  
  - **LRAS shifts with productivity/capital/labor increases.**  
  - **SRAS shifts with LRAS and changes in price expectations.**  
- **Recession recovery happens via adjustments in price expectations and wages.**

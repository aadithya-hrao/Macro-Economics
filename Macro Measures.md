1. **Macroeconomic Measures**: These are variables that help us assess the economy, with three main categories:
   - **GDP (Gross Domestic Product)**: Represents production, income, and expenditures.
   - **Prices**: Focus on the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
   - **Labor Market Variables**: Main focus on the unemployment rate.

2. **GDP**: Defined as the market value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders during a specified period.
   - **Market Value**: Allows comparison of diverse products (e.g., apples vs. cars) by using dollar values.
   - **Final Goods and Services**: Only include final goods to avoid double-counting intermediate goods (e.g., Tropicana's oranges bought for juice production don't count, but a bag of oranges bought by a consumer does).
   - **Geographic Boundaries**: GDP counts production within a country's borders, regardless of who produces it. 
   - **Time Period**: GDP is measured quarterly or annually, and only new production is counted—resold or used goods do not count.

3. **GDP per Capita**: Often used to represent standard of living, it divides GDP by the population, giving an average “slice of the pie.”

## Two Approaches to GDP:
- **Income Approach**: GDP is viewed as income for individuals and firms, including wages, rent, interest, and profits.
- **Expenditure Approach**: GDP is considered based on total expenditures, broken into:
   - **Consumption**: Household spending on goods and services.
   - **Investment**: Firms' spending on physical capital (machinery, tools).
   - **Government Purchases**: Government spending at all levels (excluding transfer payments like welfare).
   - **Net Exports**: Exports minus imports.

1. **Circular Flow Diagram**: A simplified representation of the economy where:
   - **Firms** pay income to **households** (wages, rent, interest, profits).
   - **Households** spend that income on goods and services produced by firms.
   - This shows how income, expenditures, and production are interconnected, where income equals expenditures equals production.

# Breakdown of GDP Components

This video provides a detailed breakdown of the components of GDP, focusing on consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports.

1. **Consumption (C)**
- **Largest Component**: Consumption typically accounts for about two-thirds of GDP, with the U.S. at around 68%.
- **Household Purchases**: Includes final goods and services purchased by households, like groceries (bread, eggs, milk), clothing (shirts, shoes), and other services.
- **Exceptions**: One specific household purchase, new homes, is classified under investment (discussed later).

2. **Investment (I)**
- **Definition**: Refers to gross private domestic investment, which includes private fixed investment and changes in inventories.
  
  - **Private Fixed Investment**: 
    - **Physical Capital**: Tools, equipment, factories, and machinery purchased by firms to produce goods and services.
    - **Residential Structures**: New home purchases, which are considered investments for long-term economic growth.
  
  - **Change in Inventories**: 
    - Captures the difference between goods produced but not yet sold in a given time period. This can be negative if inventory is drawn down more than it is replenished. 
    - Example: If a company produces goods in one year but sells them in the next, the production counts toward GDP in the year it’s produced, while the sale counts as consumption in the following year.

3. **Government Purchases (G)**
- **Government Spending**: Includes all purchases at federal, state, and local levels, but **does not include transfer payments**.
  - **Transfer Payments**: Social Security, unemployment benefits, and other payments that transfer money without a good or service in return. These do not count toward GDP because they do not directly contribute to production.
  - **Government Purchases**: Spending on goods and services like paying teachers or buying equipment (e.g., warships), which counts toward GDP.

4. **Net Exports (NX)**
- **Exports**: Goods and services produced domestically and sold abroad, which count towards GDP.
- **Imports**: Goods and services produced abroad but purchased domestically. Imports are subtracted from GDP because they represent production from other countries.
  - **Examples**: 
    - **Consumption**: If you buy Italian wine, consumption increases by $50, but imports also increase by $50.
    - **Investment**: If a business buys a bulldozer from Sweden, investment increases by $1 million, but imports also increase by $1 million.
    - **Government Purchases**: If the government buys warships from Sweden, government spending increases by $1 billion, but imports increase by $1 billion as well.

# How to Calculate GDP


1. **Nominal GDP vs. Real GDP**

- **Nominal GDP**: This is calculated using current prices and current quantities. It doesn't account for inflation, meaning that changes in nominal GDP may be due to price changes rather than actual changes in production.
  
- **Real GDP**: This is calculated using constant prices from a base year. It adjusts for inflation, providing a more accurate measure of changes in production or economic growth over time.

2. **When to Use Real GDP**
- If you're using **time series data** (one place across time) or **panel data** (across sections over time), real GDP should be used to ensure an accurate picture of economic growth, adjusting for inflation.

3. **Example of Nominal GDP Calculation**
Let's assume our country produces two goods: HAHA-OOPSY dolls and BB guns. We'll calculate GDP for three years using nominal terms:

- **Year 1**: 
  - HAHA-OOPSY dolls: 100 units * $10 = $1,000
  - BB guns: 50 units * $20 = $1,000
  - **Nominal GDP = $1,000 + $1,000 = $2,000**
  
- **Year 2**:
  - HAHA-OOPSY dolls: 200 units * $15 = $3,000
  - BB guns: 100 units * $30 = $3,000
  - **Nominal GDP = $3,000 + $3,000 = $6,000**
  
- **Year 3**:
  - HAHA-OOPSY dolls: 300 units * $20 = $6,000
  - BB guns: 150 units * $40 = $6,000
  - **Nominal GDP = $6,000 + $6,000 = $12,000**

4. **Example of Real GDP Calculation**
Now, let's calculate real GDP using Year 1 as the **base year**:

- **Base Year (Year 1)**: 
  - HAHA-OOPSY dolls: 100 units * $10 = $1,000
  - BB guns: 50 units * $20 = $1,000
  - **Real GDP = $1,000 + $1,000 = $2,000**
  
- **Year 2 (using Year 1 prices)**:
  - HAHA-OOPSY dolls: 200 units * $10 = $2,000
  - BB guns: 100 units * $20 = $2,000
  - **Real GDP = $2,000 + $2,000 = $4,000**
  
- **Year 3 (using Year 1 prices)**:
  - HAHA-OOPSY dolls: 300 units * $10 = $3,000
  - BB guns: 150 units * $20 = $3,000
  - **Real GDP = $3,000 + $3,000 = $6,000**

5. **Comparing Nominal and Real GDP**

- **Nominal GDP**: Shows growth from Year 1 to Year 2 by a factor of 3, and from Year 2 to Year 3 by a factor of 2.
  
- **Real GDP**: By adjusting for inflation, we get a more accurate picture of actual growth:
  - From Year 1 to Year 2: GDP doubles (no inflation adjustment).
  - From Year 2 to Year 3: GDP increases by 50%.

# GDP Shortcomings

GDP is a measure of production, and GDP per capita is often used to represent standards of living or economic well-being. However, it has its limitations, and there are several things GDP misses.

## Household Production
GDP misses household production. For example, a quilt made by someone's mother does not count toward GDP, even though it has value. While the fabric purchased for the quilt counts as part of GDP, the value added by the individual in turning the fabric into a quilt is not captured. Other household activities, such as growing food, making clothes, or creating furniture, are also omitted from GDP.

## Underground Economy
GDP also does not include the underground economy. Even though illegal activities, such as marijuana production in states where it is illegal at the federal level, generate economic activity, they are not accounted for in GDP. This means a significant portion of economic activity, especially in certain sectors, is left out.

## Leisure Time
Another aspect missed by GDP is leisure time, which is an important factor in overall well-being. GDP is a materialistic measure, focusing solely on goods and services, while happiness and satisfaction are often linked to having time to relax and recharge. For example, Western European countries often work fewer hours than the United States but may have a higher overall quality of life due to more leisure time.

## Pollution and Negative Consequences of Production
GDP does not account for the negative consequences of production, such as pollution or environmental degradation. For example, a power plant may generate billions of dollars in energy production, but if it pollutes rivers or causes environmental damage, this negative impact is not captured in GDP. 

## Crime and Social Problems
Crime and social problems are also not reflected in GDP. For instance, if an individual buys a shovel to commit a crime, the purchase counts toward GDP, but the fear and potential harm caused by the crime are not captured. This reflects the fact that GDP does not measure the overall quality of life, including factors like safety and social well-being.

## Inequality
GDP also misses inequality. While GDP per capita can give an average income per person, it does not reflect how wealth is distributed within a society. If all wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, GDP per capita will still be high, even though the majority of the population may be struggling.

# Alternatives to GDP

While GDP per capita is commonly used as a measure of well-being, it has its flaws. There are alternatives that may provide a more comprehensive picture of standards of living.

## OECD Household Disposable Income
The OECD’s Household Disposable Income index accounts for income after taxes and transfers. This index helps give a better picture of the resources available to individuals and households in different countries, making it a useful tool for cross-country comparisons.

## UN Human Development Index (HDI)
The UN’s HDI includes factors like life expectancy, education, and income to provide a broader measure of development and well-being. While useful, it can be subjective, as it is influenced by the weights and factors chosen by the creators of the index.

## Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index
Bhutan’s Gross National Happiness Index attempts to measure well-being based on happiness rather than material wealth. Although this is a subjective measure, it reflects the idea that happiness is a key component of overall well-being.

## Gini Coefficient
The Gini coefficient is one measure of inequality. It helps capture how evenly or unevenly wealth is distributed in a society. High inequality may indicate that a society's prosperity is not benefiting all its members equally, which is an important consideration when assessing well-being.

# Inflation and the Consumer Price Index (CPI)

Inflation refers to the general increase in price levels over time, which impacts the purchasing power of money. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is used to measure inflation by tracking the average cost of goods and services for consumers. Inflation has various effects, both positive and negative.

## Why Do We Care About Inflation?
Inflation can have significant costs:
- **Low and stable inflation** is generally beneficial, signaling growing demand and helping businesses plan and hire.
- **High inflation** leads to various economic challenges, reducing the value of money and affecting purchasing power.

## Types of Inflation
- **Hyperinflation**: This occurs when inflation is extremely high, leading to rapid erosion of money's value. Historical examples include post-World War I Germany, Zimbabwe in the 1990s, and Venezuela in the 2000s. Hyperinflation often forces countries to introduce new currencies.
  
- **Core Inflation**: Excludes volatile items like food and energy from the CPI to give a more stable measure of inflation, used by the Federal Reserve for long-term policy decisions.

## Causes of Inflation
A primary cause of inflation, especially hyperinflation, is excessive money printing by the central bank. There is a strong correlation between the growth of the money supply and inflation rates.

## Costs of Inflation

1. Shoe Leather Costs
- **Shoe leather costs** refer to the effort and inconvenience caused by inflation, as people try to avoid holding cash, which loses value quickly. For example, as inflation rises, you might have to make more frequent trips to the bank to withdraw smaller amounts of cash, or you might move your money into investments that offer returns to protect against inflation.

2. Distortions in the Tax System
- In a **progressive tax system**, inflation can push people into higher tax brackets even if their real income hasn't increased, reducing their purchasing power. This is because nominal wages may increase with inflation, but they are often taxed at higher rates, leading to an effective reduction in workers' real wages.

3. Unexpected Redistribution of Wealth
- Inflation can lead to an **unexpected redistribution of wealth**, especially when inflation exceeds expectations. For example, banks set nominal interest rates based on expected inflation. If inflation is higher than expected, the real return on loans decreases, harming lenders (e.g., banks), while borrowers benefit from paying back loans with "cheaper" money. This redistribution can destabilize financial systems.

4. Menu Costs
- **Menu costs** refer to the costs businesses incur when they adjust prices. For example, changing price tags or updating menus in restaurants takes time and money. There's also a **psychological cost**: when prices rise, even if consumers can afford the increase, they may reduce spending due to negative perceptions of inflation, which can harm businesses and slow economic activity.

###: 5. Noisy Signal
- **Noisy signals** refer to the difficulty in making economic decisions when inflation is unpredictable. Businesses struggle to forecast costs and set prices, while consumers find it hard to plan their spending. Constant price changes can disrupt both production and consumption, leading to inefficiencies and economic uncertainty.

# How the CPI is Calculated

- **CPI Definition**: The Consumer Price Index (CPI) measures the average cost of a fixed, weighted basket of goods and services over time.
  
- **Formula for CPI**:
  $$
  \text{CPI} = \left( \frac{\text{Price of Basket in Current Period}}{\text{Price of Basket in Base Period}} \right) \times 100
  $$

- **Steps in CPI Calculation**:
  1. **Fixed Weighted Basket**: A basket is chosen based on typical goods and services people purchase. This basket is weighted by expenditure categories such as housing, transportation, food, medical care, etc.
  2. **Price Collection**: Prices of goods and services are collected in two time periods (e.g., June 2021 and June 2022).
  3. **Basket Cost Calculation**: Multiply the quantity of each item by its price and sum to get the total basket cost in each period.

- **Deflation**: Deflation occurs when CPI decreases over time. This can lead to economic problems, as seen during the Great Depression (1931-1932). Deflation can cause firms to lower prices, incur losses, and even shut down, leading to job losses and worsening economic conditions.

- **Disinflation**: A reduction in the rate of inflation, rather than negative inflation (deflation), is more common in tough economic times.
# Shortcomings of the CPI

- **Substitution Bias**: 
  - The CPI assumes a fixed basket of goods and services, but people tend to substitute goods when prices rise.
  - Example: If the price of coffee increases, people might switch to tea or energy drinks. The CPI may overstate inflation by not accounting for these substitutions.

- **Quality Adjustment Bias**:
  - Over time, products improve in quality, but CPI may not fully adjust for this improvement.
  - Example: A computer from the 1980s costs $800, while a modern laptop costs $1,200, but the laptop offers much more value. CPI may overstate inflation by comparing these products without adjusting for their quality differences.

- **New Goods Bias**:
  - The CPI has difficulty incorporating new products into the basket, which can affect the measurement of inflation.
  - New goods increase the variety available to consumers, which can enhance the purchasing power of money, but this is not captured by the CPI.

- **Inequality**:
  - The CPI does not account for income inequality. People with lower incomes spend a larger portion of their income on items like food and gas, which are often subject to higher inflation rates.
  - Inflation affects different income groups differently, and the CPI does not consider this variation.

- **Indexing and Policy**:
  - The CPI is used to index Social Security benefits. If CPI overstates inflation, benefits may rise faster than necessary, increasing costs for taxpayers.
  - **Indexing**: Adjusting benefits according to inflation to maintain purchasing power.
  - Overstating inflation may lead to higher nominal benefits, which can become a burden on the economy.

# Alternatives to the CPI

- **Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) Index**:
  - Calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, used by the Federal Reserve for policy decisions.
  - Typically shows lower inflation than the CPI due to different methods of calculation and weighting.

- **Producer Price Index (PPI)**:
  - Also from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, this index measures prices producers pay for goods and services.
  - Can be a predictor of future CPI changes, as price increases for producers often translate to higher consumer prices.

- **GDP Deflator**:
  - Measures how domestic prices of production change over time, taking into account the entire economy's output.
  - Calculated by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the GDP deflator is subject to GDP rules and is another measure of inflation.
# Unemployment and Labor Market Variables

## Unemployment Rate
The **unemployment rate** is used to capture the percentage of people who **want to find work but cannot find work**. It is calculated as:

$$
Unemployment Rate = \dfrac{Unemployed}{Labor Force} \times 100
$$

- **Labor Force**: The total number of people who are employed or unemployed but actively seeking work.
- **Employed**: Those who worked full or part time during the past week, or were on vacation or sick from their regular job.
- **Unemployed**: Those who didn't work in the past week but have actively looked for work in the past four weeks. If you haven't looked in the past four weeks, you're considered **out of the labor force**.

## Two Surveys for Labor Market Data
- **Household Survey**: This is where the unemployment rate is reported. The survey calls 60,000 people each month to ask if they worked or were looking for work.
- **Establishment Survey**: This tracks payroll data and reports the change in employment from businesses.

## Reasons for Unemployment

1. **Fired**: Often associated with doing a bad job, though sometimes it’s due to economic conditions or workplace dynamics.
2. **Laid off**: Can happen due to economic conditions, company cutbacks, or industry-specific downturns (e.g., the decline of the typewriter industry in the '70s and '80s).
3. **Seasonal layoffs**: Some industries, like construction in cold climates, may lay off workers temporarily during off-seasons and then rehire them when conditions improve.
4. **Technological Displacement**: Workers can be replaced by machines or technology. For example:
   - **Parking garage attendants** replaced by machines.
   - **Bank tellers** replaced by ATMs.
   
   **Short-term pain vs. long-term gain**:
   - In the short run, technology can displace workers.
   - In the long run, technology tends to make workers more productive and thus more in demand.

## Creative Destruction
- **Creative destruction** refers to the cycle where old jobs are destroyed, and new jobs are created due to innovation and technology. This is a normal part of a healthy job market.
- **Long-term view**: While technology may displace some jobs, it generally leads to higher productivity and new job opportunities.

## Impact of Technology on Employment
- In the **long run**, technology tends to be beneficial to workers by making them more productive.
- However, the **short-run** effects of technology, such as the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, can be painful for workers displaced by machines. There’s ongoing debate about how AI may influence job markets in the future.

## Conclusion
- Unemployment can happen for various reasons, from personal performance issues to broader economic shifts.
- The **unemployment rate** is a crucial indicator of labor market health, though it has limitations, such as not accounting for discouraged workers who have stopped looking for jobs.

# Why Do We Care About Unemployment?

Unemployment has both **monetary** and **non-monetary** costs, which can affect individuals, businesses, and society as a whole.

## Monetary Costs of Unemployment

1. **Loss of Personal Income**:
   - When people lose their jobs, they lose their income, which limits their ability to buy goods and services. This is particularly impactful in consumption-driven economies like the United States, where approximately **2/3-70% of GDP** comes from consumption. 
   - A decrease in consumption can hurt businesses, leading to **further layoffs**, creating a **vicious cycle** where income and consumption continue to drop.

2. **Lost Skills**:
   - People who are unemployed for extended periods, especially in **technologically advanced fields**, may lose their skills, which makes it harder for them to find new work or return to the workforce.

3. **On-the-Job Training Costs**:
   - When workers are re-employed, businesses may need to invest in **training** to get their skills up to the required level, which can be costly.

4. **Increased Benefits & Lost Taxes**:
   - The social **safety net** (e.g., unemployment benefits) costs more during high unemployment periods, which can increase **government spending**, adding pressure to national **debts** and **deficits**.
   - Unemployed people are also not contributing to **tax revenue**, leading to a double burden: higher government spending and lower tax income.

## Non-Monetary Costs of Unemployment

1. **Social Costs**:
   - Unemployment can lead to **increased homelessness**, **substance abuse**, **crime**, and **social tensions**. Studies show a strong association between high unemployment rates and an increase in these social issues.

2. **Psychological Costs**:
   - **Identity and fulfillment** are tied to work. Losing a job can harm one's self-esteem and psychological well-being, as people often derive a sense of purpose and identity from their work. The feeling of being unable to find a job can lead to **depression**, **anxiety**, and feelings of failure. 
   - The metaphor of the "hot dog and bun" illustrates the importance of feeling **fulfilled** by work. Without a job, people can feel like they are a **"sad hot dog"**—unable to find their place, leading to negative self-perceptions and impacting mental health.

3. **Political Costs**:
   - High unemployment can be a **political burden** for those in power, especially during elections. Even if an administration is not directly responsible for the causes of high unemployment, they are often blamed for not solving it quickly enough.
   - Politicians may face backlash in **midterm elections** or other elections if they are seen as failing to address unemployment, which can lead to a shift in **political power**. This shift can make it harder to pass policies that could address social issues or unemployment itself.

# Types of Unemployment

Unemployment can be classified into different types, each with varying degrees of difficulty to overcome and different policy implications. The three main types are **frictional**, **structural**, and **cyclical** unemployment.

1. **Frictional Unemployment**
   - **Key Phrase**: *Job Search Process*
   - **Description**: Frictional unemployment occurs when people are temporarily without work while transitioning from one job to another, or when they are entering the workforce for the first time (e.g., fresh graduates). It takes time to find a new job that matches one’s skills and preferences. This type of unemployment is often short-term and natural in a dynamic economy.
   - **Example**: A recent college graduate who applies for jobs in Silicon Valley. It takes time to submit applications, go through interviews, and negotiate job offers.
   - **Policy Implications**: There are minimal policy implications for frictional unemployment. The job search process is usually well-supported by the private market (job boards, recruitment agencies, networking). However, improving the **job matching process** or providing resources like job search assistance can make this transition smoother.

2. **Structural Unemployment**
   - **Key Phrase**: *Skills Mismatch*
   - **Description**: Structural unemployment is more problematic and arises when there is a mismatch between the skills of workers and the demands of employers. This happens when industries shrink or shift, and workers in those sectors do not have the skills needed for available jobs in different sectors.
   - **Example**: A factory worker in the Rust Belt who has been laid off after the closure of manufacturing plants. These workers may struggle to transition to new jobs in high-tech fields like coding, especially when younger workers have acquired advanced technical skills from a young age.
   - **Policy Implications**: Structural unemployment requires more significant policy intervention. **Education and training programs** can help workers develop new skills that match market demands. **Retraining programs** and **reskilling initiatives** are crucial to help workers adapt to a changing economy.

3. **Cyclical Unemployment**
   - **Key Phrase**: *Economic Conditions*
   - **Description**: Cyclical unemployment is tied to the business cycle—rising during economic downturns and falling during periods of economic growth. It is directly linked to the overall economic health of the country and fluctuates based on **demand** for goods and services.
   - **Example**: During a recession, businesses reduce production, leading to layoffs and a rise in unemployment. Conversely, during periods of economic growth, cyclical unemployment tends to decrease as companies hire more workers to meet rising demand.
   - **Natural Rate of Unemployment**: This rate is the baseline level of unemployment that accounts for **frictional** and **structural** unemployment (sometimes referred to as the "natural rate of unemployment"). It reflects the level of unemployment that exists even when the economy is at full employment.

 **Cyclical Unemployment Formula**: 
$$
       \text{Cyclical Unemployment} = \text{Actual Unemployment Rate} - \text{Natural Rate of Unemployment}
$$

**Policy Implications**: To address cyclical unemployment, governments often implement **counter-cyclical fiscal policies** (such as stimulus spending) and **monetary policies** (like interest rate adjustments) to boost economic activity during downturns.

## Summary of the Types of Unemployment

| Type of Unemployment        | Key Characteristic            | Policy Implications                                |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frictional Unemployment** | Job search process            | Minimal intervention, improve job matching systems |
| **Structural Unemployment** | Skills mismatch               | Education, retraining, and reskilling programs     |
| **Cyclical Unemployment**   | Linked to economic conditions | Counter-cyclical fiscal and monetary policies      |
# Unemployment and Participation Rates: A Summary

Now we're going to look here at how we calculate both our **unemployment rate** and our **participation rate**. 

The **unemployment rate** is essentially trying to capture the percentage of people who **want to work** but **cannot find work**. 

I find whenever you look at the unemployment rate, you should really complement that by looking at the **participation rate**. The participation rate tries to capture the people who want to work out of those we deem eligible to work, our working age population (16 or older, civilian, non-institutionalized population). That's our general pool of people that we have to draw from for our labor force.

## Why Should They Be Looked at Together?
The unemployment rate is often criticized for missing some of the pain out there in the labor market. The unemployment rate can go down sometimes because people just stop looking for work. If you haven't looked for work in the past four weeks, you're dropped out of the labor force. You might be discouraged and stop looking, and your pain is missed in the labor market. 

The participation rate helps us understand what's going on in the unemployment rate better. When you look at them together, you get a better idea of the big picture in the labor market.

The participation rate will capture if the unemployment rate goes down for a bad reason. Sometimes the unemployment rate goes up, and it's for a good reason—people are getting confidence in the labor market, so they start to look for jobs again. As they go out and start to look for jobs, that's going to push that unemployment rate up, but the participation rate will go up as well.

## How We Calculate Unemployment Rate and Participation Rate

- **Unemployment Rate**:
  $$
  \text{Unemployment Rate} = \frac{\text{Unemployed}}{\text{Labor Force}} \times 100
  $$
  The **labor force** includes both the unemployed and employed. The unemployed are those who cannot find a job, and the employed are those who have found one.

- **Participation Rate**:
  $$
  \text{Participation Rate} = \frac{\text{Labor Force}}{\text{Working Age Population}} \times 100
  $$

Again, if the unemployment rate comes down for a bad reason, the participation rate will tell us, it will come down. If unemployment rates go up for a good reason, the participation rate can help us understand that. The participation rate will go up.

## Alternative Measures for Unemployment

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) introduced several alternative measures for unemployment to capture the pain that the official unemployment rate might miss:

1. **Marginally Attached**:
   These individuals haven’t looked for work in the past four weeks but have looked in the past 12 months and still want a job.
   
2. **Discouraged Workers**:
   These are a subset of the marginally attached. They haven’t looked for work in the past four weeks because they feel discouraged, often due to a perceived lack of available jobs or not having the required skills.
   
3. **Involuntary Part-Time Workers**:
   People who want to work full-time but can only find part-time work (also known as being underemployed).

4. **Chronically Unemployed**:
   These are people who have been unemployed for a long period (typically 15 weeks or more).
